Security frameworks

    guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy

    purpose of frameworks

        protecting PIIs(personally identifiable info), securing financial information, identifying security weaknesses,
         managing organizational risks, and aligning security with business goals.

    
    There are several security frameworks that may be used to manage different types of organizational and regulatory compliance risks.

    Frameworks have four core component
        identifying and documenting security goals
        setting guidelines to achieve security goals.           
        implementing strong security processes
        monitoring and communicating results



    Frameworks allow analysts to work alongside other members of the security team to document, implement,
        and use the policies and procedures that have been created. It's essential for an entry-level analyst to understand this process
         because it directly affects the work they do and how they collaborate with others


Security controls
    safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks => alongside frameworks => to ensure that security goals and processes are
     implemented correctly and that organizations meet regulatory compliance requirements.


Asset: is an item perceived as having value to an organization. value is determined by the cost associated with the asset in question.


NIST CSF: Specific framework developed by the U.S.-based National Institute of Standards and Technology: the Cybersecurity Framework,
 also referred to as the NIST CSF. The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is a voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines,
  and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk.

=> baseline to manage short and long-term risk => used to develop processes to secure organizations and the people they serve =>
    Understanding the different motives a threat actor may have
    Identifying your organization's most valuable assets

security frameworks provide a structured approach to implementing a security lifecycle.
    Security lifecycle is a constantly evolving set of policies and standards.

    four core components:

    Identifying and documenting security goals 

    Setting guidelines to achieve security goals 

    Implementing strong security processes

    Monitoring and communicating results

Compliance is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations

Examples of frameworks:
    
    NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)


    FERC-NERC is a regulation that applies to organizations that work with electricity or that are involved with the U.S power grid
    => legally required to adhere to the Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Reliability Standards defined by the FERC.


    FedRAMP is a U.S. federal government program that standardizes security assessment, authorization, monitoring, and handling of
    cloud services and product offerings. Its purpose is to provide consistency across the government sector and third-party cloud providers.


    CIS is a nonprofit with multiple areas of emphasis. It provides a set of controls that can be used to safeguard systems and networks against attacks. 
    provides actionable controls that security professionals may follow if a security incident occurs. 


    GDPR is a European Union (E.U.) general data regulation that protects the processing of E.U. residents’ data and their right to privacy in and out of E.U.
    territory. For example, if an organization is not being transparent about the data they are holding about an E.U. citizen and why they are holding that data,
    this is an infringement that can result in a fine to the organization. Additionally, if a breach occurs and an E.U. citizen’s data is compromised, they must be informed.
    The affected organization has 72 hours to notify the E.U. citizen about the breach


    PCI DSS is an international security standard meant to ensure that organizations storing, accepting, processing, and transmitting credit card information do so in a secure environment.
    The objective of this compliance standard is to reduce credit card fraud. 


    The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
        HIPAA is a U.S. federal law established in 1996 to protect patients' health information. This law prohibits patient information from being shared without their consent.
        It is governed by three rules: 

            Privacy

            Security 

            Breach notification 

    Organizations that store patient data have a legal obligation to inform patients of a breach because if patients' Protected Health Information (PHI) is exposed,
    it can lead to identity theft and insurance fraud. PHI relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual,
    whether it’s a plan of care or payments for care. Along with understanding HIPAA as a law, security professionals also need to be familiar with the Health
    Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST®), which is a security framework and assurance program that helps institutions meet HIPAA compliance.


    International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 
    ISO was created to establish international standards related to technology, manufacturing, and management across borders. It helps organizations improve their
    processes and procedures for staff retention, planning, waste, and services.



    The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), or Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999,
    requires financial institutions to protect consumers' private information. It includes three main components:

        Financial Privacy Rule: Institutions must inform customers about data collection and sharing practices and allow them to opt out of sharing with non-affiliated third parties.
        Safeguards Rule: Institutions must implement security measures to protect customer data from unauthorized access or misuse.
        Pretexting Provisions: The act prohibits obtaining personal data under false pretenses.
        The GLBA applies to banks, credit unions, and other institutions handling financial information, requiring regular risk assessments, staff training, and security policy updates.
        Non-compliance can lead to fines and reputational harm.





    The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), passed in 2002, is a U.S. law to improve corporate accountability and protect investors by ensuring accurate financial reporting. It includes key provisions:

        Executive Certification (Section 302 & 906): CEOs and CFOs must personally certify the accuracy of financial statements, holding them accountable for any misrepresentations.
        Internal Controls (Section 404): Companies must implement and assess internal controls over financial reporting, with external audits.
        Document Integrity (Section 802): Sets penalties for tampering with financial records.
        Whistleblower Protection (Section 806): Shields employees who report fraud from retaliation.
        SOX mandates transparency and aims to prevent corporate fraud, with severe penalties for non-compliance, including fines and jail time for executives.



Based on the data we are storing, we must know the laws of keeping and securing that data and adhere to them.
