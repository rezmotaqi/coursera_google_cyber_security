SIEM Tools
    Purpose: Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools collect and analyze log data, helping organizations monitor activities,
     detect threats, and alert analysts to potential risks.
    Dashboards: They offer visual dashboards for categorizing and reviewing data.
    Hosting Options: Available in both on-premise and cloud-hosted options, with cloud hosting often preferred by less experienced teams due
     to its ease of setup and maintenance.


Network Protocol Analyzers (Packet Sniffers)

    Function: Capture and analyze data traffic within a network, recording all interactions a computer encounters.
     Common tools in this category are known as packet sniffers.
    Usage: Useful for security analysts to understand network activity and troubleshoot issues by examining captured data.


Playbooks
    Definition: Manuals outlining operational actions and procedures for handling security incidents.
    Example Scenario: In a security breach at a small medical practice, a playbook could guide an analyst through forensic investigation steps
     to support an insurance claim.
    Types of Playbooks in Forensic Investigations:

        Chain of Custody: Ensures that evidence is tracked and documented throughout the incident lifecycle to prevent mishandling.
        Protecting and Preserving Evidence: Focuses on managing volatile digital evidence to maintain its integrity, using methods like
         copying data to work on preserved copies, thereby preventing loss or alteration of original evidence.

Key Takeaways
    SIEM tools, network protocol analyzers, and playbooks are essential tools for security analysts.
    Playbooks, especially for chain of custody and evidence preservation, are critical in forensic investigations, 
     helping ensure evidence is handled correctly.
    Forensic investigation is a broad field with more tools and procedures to explore beyond these basics.  




Programming and Automation

    Programming: Security analysts use languages like Python for automation to perform repetitive tasks efficiently and reduce human error.
     SQL is another language used to interact with databases, allowing analysts to manage and query vast amounts of data.

Operating Systems
    Linux, macOS, and Windows: Each operating system provides unique functionality. Linux is open-source and involves using a command-line interface
     for executing commands, making it popular among security professionals.

Security Tools and Their Purposes
    Web Vulnerability: Flaws in web applications that attackers can exploit. Staying updated on web vulnerabilities
        (like those listed in the OWASP Top 10) is crucial to protecting applications.

Antivirus Software: Detects, prevents, and eliminates malware and viruses by scanning device memory for malicious patterns.

Intrusion Detection System (IDS): Monitors system activity and detects potential intrusions by analyzing network packets for unusual behavior.

Encryption: Converts readable data (plaintext) into secure, encoded data (ciphertext) to maintain confidentiality and prevent unauthorized access.

Penetration Testing
    Pen Testing: Simulated attacks to identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, and applications, helping organizations evaluate their
     security posture.

Key Takeaways
    Tool Knowledge: Security analysts benefit from familiarity with a wide range of tools to perform tasks efficiently.
    The more tools and processes you know, the more valuable you are in a security role.
